<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project serves as an assignment for the PRJ301 - Programming with Java Web at FPT University. Students are tasked with applying the Java programming knowledge acquired in the pre-requisite course, PRO192 (Programming OOP with Java) and apply them in conjunction with database knowledge gained from DBI202 (Introduction to Database). to develop a practical, real-life application.

## Usage

- Below is a demonstration for this basic CRUD Java Web Project.
  ![Demo](./gif/Animation.gif)

## Requirement

- Project name: Student Management Web Application with CRUD Functionality

## Key Features

- Java Web Application: A project focused on student management.

- User Registration: Users can create accounts with usernames, full names, and passwords.

- Login and Logout: Registered users can securely log in and out of their accounts.

- Session Management: Utilizes sessions to maintain user information across browsing sessions.

- CRUD Functionality: Basic CRUD operations enable users to manage student data effectively.

- Design Pattern: Implements the MVC2 (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for a structured and maintainable architecture.

## How To Use

**Prerequisites:**

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the latest JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run the project. Make sure your IDE supports Java development.

- Database Management System: This project is designed to work with Microsoft SQL Server. While other SQL databases may work, it's recommended to use Microsoft SQL Server for compatibility.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. **Download and Extract the Project:**

   - Download the project files from the repository and extract them to a directory on your computer.

2. **Open the Project in your IDE:**

   - Launch your preferred IDE that supports Java development.
   - Import the extracted project into your IDE workspace.

3. **Configure the Database Connection:**

   - Locate the `DBUtils` package within the project.
   - Modify the database connection settings if necessary. You may need to adjust the username and password to match your SQL Server configuration.

4. **Run the Application:**

   - Once the project is set up and the database connection is configured, run the application from your IDE.

5. **Explore the Features:**
   - Navigate through the application to explore its functionalities.
   - Register an account using a username, full name, and password.
   - Log in with your registered account to access the student management features.
   - Utilize the CRUD functions to manage student data efficiently.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- ## Getting Started

To run the project, you need to follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

1. Firstly, you need to install JDK (Java Development Kit) which plays an important role in providing necessary tools and libraries to execute the code.

2. After you have downloaded and installed JDK,  you will need to go through the same process with an IDE (Integrated development environment).

There are many IDEs now available on the internet to run Java code, such as VSCode, Eclipse, ... but I highly recommend **Netbeans** or **IntelliJ** due to their stability."

Finally, download this project to your computer, extract it and run with the IDE that you have just installed

In the project, locate the 'FlightManagementSystem' class. This class serves as the main class and functions as the entry point of the program. Select the 'FlightManagementSystem' class, run it, and you are good to go! -->

<!-- ### Installation

* Click [Here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to download and install the JDK

* Click [Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) to download and install Intellij IDEA

OR
* Click [Here](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/) to download and install NetBeans

Notice that if you are accustomed to using another IDE not listed here, feel free to use it anyway.
